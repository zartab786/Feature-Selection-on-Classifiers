# Feature-Selection-on-Classifiers
Text classifiers that classify the data to a most matching class amongst multiple classes.

#Dataset is 20 newsgroups dataset: http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/
How to RUN the code :
- Folder Contains the two ipynb files one for the code Naive Bayes other for KNN.
- Open the ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the code snippet by snippet (i.e Jupyter Cell by Cell).
-In each cell of the code proper comments are mentioned kindly read it.
- In both codes you can change the splitting ratio of the documents (in training and testing) as per need.
- For each new splitting ratio the entire code from top to the bottom is to be run again.
- No pickle file is maintained as most of the code running time is bare minimum.
- The MI Feature collection part takes about 5 minutes to complete.
- The tf-idf dictionary of words calculation part in case of KNN takes about 4 minutes.
- The entire KNN algorithm for a given value of k runs about 3 to 4 minutes only.
